      <h2>Hello, I'm SEMER</h2>
      <p>I’m a junior web developer who loves building beautiful, responsive, and intuitive websites. I focus on user-friendly interfaces, creative layouts, and web accessibility. Always learning and pushing forward!</p>
      <p>My toolbox includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks. I’m currently diving into React and animations to make my projects even more interactive.</p>

    <h1 style="color: red ;">A Little About Me</h1>
    <div class="timeline-box">
      <h3>2003 – Born Curious</h3>
      <p>
        Born with a head full of questions and a habit of taking things
         apart mostly remote controls and toy cars. Grew up fascinated 
         by how things worked, whether it was a clock or a computer.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-box">
      <h3>2013 – A Creative Spark</h3>
      <p>Loved to sketch, draw, and mess with gadgets</p>

      <p>I wasn’t into sports like most kids—I was busy drawing superheroes 
        and fiddling with old mobile phones. I liked making things. 
        Even then, I knew I’d do something creative one day.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-box">
      <h3>2017 – First Glimpse of the Digital World</h3>
      <p>Discovered tech through curiosity. </p>

      <p>I still remember the first time I edited a blog template.
         The feeling of changing code and seeing the result instantly pure magic.
          That’s when the idea of building stuff on the internet first clicked.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-box">
      <h3>2019 – School Days, Big Dreams</h3>
      <p>Started thinking about the future</p>

      <p>High school was where I realized I liked solving problems more than
         memorizing answers. I didn’t have a clear path yet, but I knew I
          wanted to build, create, and learn on my own terms.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-box">
      <h3> 2023 – Choosing the Self-Taught Path</h3>
      <p>Skipped the traditional route</p>

      <p>While others were applying to college, I started learning online.
         HTML, CSS, JavaScript one free course at a time. It wasn’t easy, 
         but it was mine. I learned to learn on my own.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-box">
      <h3>2024 – Building for Real</h3>

      <p>Started creating digital things that actually worked</p>

      <p>Projects went from “hello world” to real websites, components,
         and tools. Each new bug was a challenge. Each finished project
          was a victory. And every line of code built not just
           websites but confidence.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="timeline-box">
      <h3>2024 – More Than Code</h3>
      <p>Grew into a storyteller, problem solver, and collaborator</p>

      <p>Tech became the tool. Creativity became the drive. I started giving back,
         joining communities, mentoring new devs, and thinking about problems
          beyond just the screen.
        </p>
    </div>



    <div class="timeline-box">

      <h3>2025 – Where I Am Now</h3>
      <p>Still curious. Still building. Still becoming.</p>

      <p>
        Today, I’m focused on growth—in code, in creativity, and in life.
         This site is more than a portfolio; it’s a reflection of who I
          am and where I’m going. I’m not in a rush. I’m here for the journey.

      <h2>  Beginnings in the Quiet Corners of the Web</h2>
      <p>There was no formal classroom. No professor.
         Just a hand-me-down laptop, a late-night Google 
         search, and a growing fascination with how websites
          worked.</p>

         <p>My name is <strong>SEMER KELIL</strong>,
           and like many self-taught developers,
            my journey into web development didn’t
             start with a CS degree ,it started with curiosity.
             I stumbled upon the “Inspect Element” tool while customizing a
             Tumblr theme. That small moment lit a spark. One “how to make 
             a website” YouTube video led to another. Before I knew it,
              I was knee-deep in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

                <p>I didn’t know it then, but building my own Articles page would 
                  become a defining milestone in my journey—not just as a
                   developer, but as a thinker.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>The Idea Behind the Articles Page</h2>
      <p>At first, my website was just a résumé in disguise some projects,
         a "Hello World" homepage, and contact links. But it felt... 
         empty. I wanted it to say more. To show more.</p>

         <p>That’s when the idea hit me:
          <strong>“What if I could turn my learning process into content? What if my portfolio had a voice?”</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to create an Articles page a digital library of my 
          thoughts, experiments, and breakthroughs. Not only would it
           be a personal journal of my progress, but it would also
            become a resource for others who were just a few steps behind me.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Writing as a Developer
      </h2>

      
      <p>
        I’m not a natural writer. I’m a thinker who types slowly. 
        But something magical happens when you try to explain 
        something to others:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>“How I Finally Understood Flexbox”</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        I wrote it not because I mastered it, but because I struggled with
         it for weeks. That’s what made it real.
        Over time, my writing improved. My voice got clearer. My imposter
        syndrome softened every time someone DM’d me to say, “This helped me a lot, thanks!”
      </p>

      <p><strong>Topics I Covered:
      </strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Learning React useEffect the hard way.</li>
        <li>My first freelance gig and what I wish I knew.</li>
        <li>Why I stopped chasing 100% test scores on freeCodeCamp.</li>
        <li>The difference between “knowing” and “debugging”.</li>
      </ul>

     
    </div>


    <div>
      <h2>Unexpected Opportunities</h2>
      <p>
        After launching my Articles page, something interesting happened:
      </p>

      <p>
        People started finding me.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn after reading my post about building a to-do app in React.</li>
        <li>A fellow dev from India emailed to collaborate on a blog series.</li>
        <li>My article was even shared in a Reddit thread about learning Flexbox.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That page, which started as a small corner of my site, became the beating heart of my portfolio.
        It wasn't just a showcase of code—it was a showcase of thought.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> What I Learned Along the Way</h2>

      <strong>1. You Don’t Have to Be an Expert to Teach</strong>
      <p>
        Write while you’re learning. Your struggles will help someone else who’s stuck.
      </p>


      <strong>2. Design Is Communication</strong>
      <p>  
        A clean, readable layout matters more than flashy animations. Let your content breathe.
      </p>

      <strong>3. Consistency Beats Perfection</strong>
      <p>
       
        Publishing small posts consistently will beat waiting months for the “perfect” tutorial.
      </p>

      <strong>4. Learning in Public Builds Confidence</strong>
      <p>
        
        When you share, you grow faster. You open doors.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>
        I still don’t know everything. I still Google “how to center 
        a div” sometimes. But now, I have a place where I can document 
        that growth, inspire others, and remind myself how far I’ve come.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Articles page?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It’s more than a blog.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a <strong>mirror of my learning, a magnet for opportunity, and a message to others:</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
  <strong>You don’t need permission to build. You just need momentum.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Final Words</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re a self-taught developer reading this:
Start writing. Start sharing. Start building your Articles page.
Don’t wait to become an “expert.” Let your journey be the content.
Your story matters. Your site can be more than a portfolio.
It can be your personal developer documentary and your Articles page is the narration.
